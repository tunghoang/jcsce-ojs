## Usage

This component is a root component which is used to render a page of the editorial backend. It manages the layout architecture, including the main navigation menu, tasks and user navigation dropdown.

Nothing is needed to load the `Page` component. It is initialized automatically for every page in the editorial backend. Learn more about the [application's frontend](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/frontend).

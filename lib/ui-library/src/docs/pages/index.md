# PKP UI Library

This library contains UI components implemented or planned for the Public Knowledge Project's applications [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/), [Open Preprint Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ops/) and [Open Monograph Press](https://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/).

It provides a demonstration of each component, technical documentation, and usage guidance. It is intended for technical developers who want to work with the UI of the editorial backend for one of our applications.

You do not need to consult this guide unless you want to make substantial changes to the editorial backend. These may include:

- Create a new page with your own components
- Replace an existing page with a customized display
- Maintain or improve the existing components
- Learn how to write your own components
